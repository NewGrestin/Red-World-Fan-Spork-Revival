  RWE_USA_hostile_congress:0 "Hostile Congress"
  RWE_USA_hostile_congress_desc:0 "Since 2009, the United States government has been effectively closed due to the victory of the Common Sense Party in 2008 and the lacking strategy of House minority whip Newt Gingrich. The issue boiled over during negotiations on a new budget, as the deficit of the American Republic has reached a critical level and an impending debt-ceiling crisis looms over Rumsfeld's presidency. \n\nDiscourse between the legislative and executive branches of government have become increasingly spiteful, as Rumsfeld threatens to use his position as Commander-in-Chief and besiege Congress, while Congress threatens with impeachment. Even inside the GOP, members of the moderate caucus have become fed up with the inability of the government to compromise. The noose tightens around Rumsfeld's neck. Can he save his administration?"
  RWE_USA_extreme_rural_poverty:0 "Extreme Rural Poverty"
  RWE_USA_extreme_rural_poverty_desc:0 "In inheriting the Southern United States after the fall of the USA, the American Republic inherited the part of the country where economic disparity was perhaps most pronounced among the ex-USA states. Some of the poorest states of the old USA, such as Mississippi, Alabama and Kentucky, would align themselves with Bush's American Republic. The inequality between these rural states and the East, where the offices of power would be vested, are immense and the fall of the old US institutions hasn't helped their problems. Maintenance of basic infrastructure in sectors such as energy, communication, water and transport, has degrared far below the Republic's national average, as the Atlanta government struggles with the redistribution of its decreasing income among the states. In 2010, the percentage of individuals living in poverty has reached a staggering 32% in these rural states, which is especially pronounced in their minority communities, though not restricted to them. \n\nIn this current situation, the Republic's economy is stagnating. There's immense room to grow, but lacking funding for the poorest states leaves this room occupied with bad infrastructure, a lacking consumer base, decreasing quality of life and intense internal migration from the West to the East, as those with the chance to better their opportunity leave Alabama's swamps for Atlanta's skyscrapers and Florida's beaches."  
  RWE_USA_Anti_Soviet_Laws:0 "Communist Control Act of 2001"
  RWE_USA_Anti_Soviet_Laws_desc:0 "The Communist Control Act of 2001 was based on previous legislation, put in place prior to the fall of the United States to prevent government officials from holding radical opinions, and laws passed during the Bush administration that criminalized the Communist Party USA and IWW. The CCA of 2001 expanded restrictions by introducing limits to the registration of national and local political parties based on characteristics such as professed ideology and limits to access to ballots for those that: \n\n \"§Woppose the most basic of American values, advocate for subversion of the Republic's constitution, advocate for violations of the Republic's territorial integrity, discredit the Republic's armed forces or profess loyalty to foreign states§!\". \n\nThe CCA of 2001 has been rather vaguely applied, leading to accusations of political persecution. The act has been applied in various cases, with its most controversial application being the attempted banning of the Common Sense Party from ballots in Kentucky, which was overturned by the Supreme Court. Still the CCA keeps many potential parties outside the Republic's political system, preserving the GOP monopoly on politics." 
  RWE_USA_Default:0 "Automatic Default"
  RWE_USA_Default_desc:0 "By hitting the debt ceiling, the government has become unable to pay off large shares of its deficit, automatically defaulting on them in principle. The event has caused trust in the system to collapse, as stock markets are closed early and government employees return home without pay." 
  RWE_USA_Unrecognized_Government:0 "Unrecognized Government"
  RWE_USA_Unrecognized_Government_desc:0 "Despite our clear direct claim to the entirety of the old United States, the rest of the international community doesn't recognize it. Even worse, a large part of the Soviet-led world order doesn't recognize us as a state actor at all, instead opting to declare us a pariah state and embargo us." 

  RWE_USA_increased_taxation:0 "Higher Income Tax"

  USA_the_default_crisis:0 "A Crisis of National Debt"
  USA_the_default_crisis_desc:0 "The worst outcome has happened: Congress has kept the budget act from being passed, triggering the Republic to default on its national debt. Trust in our economy lies in shatters and Rumsfeld is left to pick up the pieces, as the threat of impeachment now looms."
  USA_devalue_the_dollar:0 "Devalue the Dollar"
  USA_devalue_the_dollar_desc:0 "As the debt crisis continues to shake us, hard decisions need to be made to safe the situation. The option of devalueing the dollar seems wise, as lowering the value of the dollar gives us some space to breath in the repaying of our debt. At the same time, devalueing the dollar will hit millions of lives, who suddenly find the value of their savings gone with the wind."
  USA_continue_payments:0 "Preserve Trust in Payment"
  USA_continue_payments_desc:0 "Despite our crisis, we cannot ignore our fiscal responsibilities. The decision needs to be made to continue paying the most essential parts of our debt, while promising the payment of debt we cannot currently pay at a later date. While not the solution, it may keep some trust in the government and economy, preventing a total collapse."  
  USA_restructure_the_debt:0 "Restructure our Debt"
  USA_restructure_the_debt_desc:0 "The situation is uncompromisable as our treasury is in disarray. The decision has to be taken to restructure our entire national debt and cut some of the fat of our debt. This will not be approved of among our collecters, but we have little choice if we want to save our finances."  
  USA_pause_social_programs:0 "Pause Welfare Programs"
  USA_pause_social_programs_desc:0 "Part of the reason of our great debt is the programs broughts to the United States after the 70s, which Reagan failed to cut. With the nation's finances in freefall, many social programs need to be stopped for extended periods of time, allowing our finances to recover from the debt ceiling crisis."  
  USA_slash_military_spending:0 "Slash the Pentagon Budget"
  USA_slash_military_spending_desc:0 "The military budget of the Republic remains far too high for the economy we maintain. The amount of financial pressure put on the treasury by our modern army alone is astounding and we need to recognize that fact. While external threats remain, we should worry first about our internal threats before we can even think about fighting the external other."
  USA_increase_middle_income_tax:0 "Read My Lips..."
  USA_increase_middle_income_tax_desc:0 "Former president Bush famously promised to read his lips. We have to break his promise. The ex-president could not have known how deep in the red we have found our nation to be in and taxation is one of only a few options we continue to have as the treasury burns. This will very likely cost us the presidency, but taxation will need to be increased."
  USA_true_republican_economy:0 "Republican Two-Year Plan"
  USA_true_republican_economy_desc:0 "Representing to the Congress, the Republican Party has made budget free for a two-year plan, seeking to kick-start the Southern economy through expansion of the manufacturing industry of the South. Already, industrial plants dot the Southern states due to the cheap labour and local access to goods. The Two Year Plan seeks to utilize our advantages and turn them into more cold, hard cash."
  USA_nationalize_the_bank_of_america:0 "Nationalize Bank of America"
  USA_nationalize_the_bank_of_america_desc:0 "The Bank of America has become the largest financial institute inside the American Republic, a true example of \"too big to fail\". It was the Bank of America's speculation that caused a crash of the economy in 2001, repressing national GDP for almost a decade. Their failure cannot be accepted any longer and nationalization of the bank seems to be the only answer moving forward."
  USA_finish_privatization:0 "Finish Privatization"
  USA_finish_privatization_desc:0 "Under Bush, some industries of the American Republic would experience nationalization under the guise of national security, such as the energy and communications sector. These sectors have been slowly privatized under Rumsfeld, but this should be the final push. Through the establishment of a couple of new companies, we can ensure a total free market in the most free nation on Earth."

As a POTUS without a Congress, Rumsfeld has often butted heads with the legislature, which has led to the current crisis. Congress has refused to raise the debt ceiling despite pleas from the Treasury as it quickly approaches the ceiling, overseeing a national debt that cannot be fixed in the short term. Rumsfeld is personally invested in the crisis and has been involved in negotiations with members of Congress, including with the party whips of Common Sense (Newt Gingrich) and the NPP (Clay Higgins), but has been unable to cross the aisle and reach an agreement with the opposition. Voices inside the administration have already proposed the disbanding of the Congress as the only solution to the problem, declaring that the constitution never planned for the contemporary situation of the American Republic."

  us_republic.1.t:0 "Briefing on the Congressional Situation"
  us_republic.1.d:0 "Good morning, Mr. President, \n\nThe Congress of the Republic lost its GOP majority in 2008 after the poorest showing since the inception of our Republic in Atlanta by former president Bush. With our poor showing, the Common Sense Party and the New Populist Party gained a foot in the door of Congress, despite the GOP remaining the biggest party. Since 2008, cooperation between the three main parties has become the modus operandi of Rumsfeld's administration. The NPP has become a close partner in this, with Common Sense remaining obstructionist. \n\nHowever, the status quo suddenly changed in late 2009, as the issue of the debt ceiling was taken up by Congress. The normal decision to increase the ceiling was suddenly blocked by the NPP, which joined Common Sense in its obstructionist ways due to its overly libertarian economics. Duke rallied against the ceiling in his usual, far-right fashion, tying it to Jewish conspiracies, while Common Sense blocked the ceiling increase on the basis of opposing the spending deficit. The Presidency is now held hostage by Congress, putting a gun to Rumsfeld's head and forcing him to compromise with either the radicals of the NPP, whose ideological motivation may not allow for serious negotiations, or Common Sense."

  us_republic.2.t:0 "The Plot against Congress"
  us_republic.2.d:0 "Frustration has beset the Rumsfeld administration. Congress has acted outside of its jurisdiction and the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, needs to take back control of the anarchist House and Senate. Behind closed doors, decisions are being made and plans are drawn up. A conspiracy is brewing in Atlanta and it will decide America's faith for the coming decades."

  us_republic.99.a:0 "Damn it!"
