  RWE_USA_hostile_congress:0 "Hostile Congress"
  RWE_USA_hostile_congress_desc:0 "Since 2009, the United States government has been effectively closed due to the victory of the Common Sense Party in 2008 and the lacking strategy of House minority whip Newt Gingrich. The issue boiled over during negotiations on a new budget, as the deficit of the American Republic has reached a critical level and an impending debt-ceiling crisis looms over Rumsfeld's presidency. \n\nDiscourse between the legislative and executive branches of government have become increasingly spiteful, as Rumsfeld threatens to use his position as Commander-in-Chief and besiege Congress, while Congress threatens with impeachment. Even inside the GOP, members of the moderate caucus have become fed up with the inability of the government to compromise. The noose tightens around Rumsfeld's neck. Can he save his administration?"
  RWE_USA_extreme_rural_poverty:0 "Extreme Rural Poverty"
  RWE_USA_extreme_rural_poverty_desc:0 "In inheriting the Southern United States after the fall of the USA, the American Republic inherited the part of the country where economic disparity was perhaps most pronounced among the ex-USA states. Some of the poorest states of the old USA, such as Mississippi, Alabama and Kentucky, would align themselves with Bush's American Republic. The inequality between these rural states and the East, where the offices of power would be vested, are immense and the fall of the old US institutions hasn't helped their problems. Maintenance of basic infrastructure in sectors such as energy, communication, water and transport, has degrared far below the Republic's national average, as the Atlanta government struggles with the redistribution of its decreasing income among the states. In 2010, the percentage of individuals living in poverty has reached a staggering 32% in these rural states, which is especially pronounced in their minority communities, though not restricted to them. \n\nIn this current situation, the Republic's economy is stagnating. There's immense room to grow, but lacking funding for the poorest states leaves this room occupied with bad infrastructure, a lacking consumer base, decreasing quality of life and intense internal migration from the West to the East, as those with the chance to better their opportunity leave Alabama's swamps for Atlanta's skyscrapers and Florida's beaches."  
  RWE_USA_Anti_Soviet_Laws:0 "Communist Control Act of 2001"
  RWE_USA_Anti_Soviet_Laws_desc:0 "The Communist Control Act of 2001 was based on previous legislation, put in place prior to the fall of the United States to prevent government officials from holding radical opinions, and laws passed during the Bush administration that criminalized the Communist Party USA and IWW. The CCA of 2001 expanded restrictions by introducing limits to the registration of national and local political parties based on characteristics such as professed ideology and limits to access to ballots for those that: \n\n \"§Woppose the most basic of American values, advocate for subversion of the Republic's constitution, advocate for violations of the Republic's territorial integrity, discredit the Republic's armed forces or profess loyalty to foreign states§!\". \n\nThe CCA of 2001 has been rather vaguely applied, leading to accusations of political persecution. The act has been applied in various cases, with its most controversial application being the attempted banning of the Common Sense Party from ballots in Kentucky, which was overturned by the Supreme Court. Still the CCA keeps many potential parties outside the Republic's political system, preserving the GOP monopoly on politics."

With the richest parts of the country falling to Soviet-backed communists and revolutionary anarchists, the pre-existing oligarchy of the old USA fled to the South and made it their playground. \n\nToday, their influence on the Republic's politics is immense. They maintain good relations with the GOP, but aren't motivated by ideology nor personal relations. They are only motivated by profit.

The spending on the Republic's Armed Forces has been a central driver of the financial problems of Atlanta, forcing the national budget into a deficit since its foundation and inhibiting spending in other areas that would help the country escape the vicious poverty cycle. Despite this huge budget, the military still is too big for its state, limiting the efficiency of our military operations heavily. Expansion of the current army is simply not an option with the budgetary restraints of the Republic and so we are stuck with a huge military with quite limited capabilities."

  USA_the_default_crisis_desc:0 "The worst outcome has happened: Congress has kept the budget act from being passed, triggering the Republic to default on its national debt. Trust in our economy lies in shatters and Rumsfeld is left to pick up the pieces, as the threat of impeachment now looms."
  USA_devalue_the_dollar:0 "Devalue the Dollar"
  USA_devalue_the_dollar_desc:0 "As the debt crisis continues to shake us, hard decisions need to be made to safe the situation. The option of devalueing the dollar seems wise, as lowering the value of the dollar gives us some space to breath in the repaying of our debt. At the same time, devalueing the dollar will hit millions of lives, who suddenly find the value of their savings gone with the wind."
  USA_continue_payments:0 "Preserve Trust in Payment"
  USA_continue_payments_desc:0 "Despite our crisis, we cannot ignore our fiscal responsibilities. The decision needs to be made to continue paying the most essential parts of our debt, while promising the payment of debt we cannot currently pay at a later date. While not the solution, it may keep some trust in the government and economy, preventing a total collapse."  
  USA_restructure_the_debt:0 "Restructure our Debt"
  USA_restructure_the_debt_desc:0 "The situation is uncompromisable as our treasury is in disarray. The decision has to be taken to restructure our entire national debt and cut some of the fat of our debt. This will not be approved of among our collecters, but we have little choice if we want to save our finances."  
  USA_pause_social_programs:0 "Pause Welfare Programs"
  USA_pause_social_programs_desc:0 "Part of the reason of our great debt is the programs broughts to the United States after the 70s, which Reagan failed to cut. With the nation's finances in freefall, many social programs need to be stopped for extended periods of time, allowing our finances to recover from the debt ceiling crisis."  
  USA_slash_military_spending:0 "Slash the Pentagon Budget"
  USA_slash_military_spending_desc:0 "The military budget of the Republic remains far too high for the economy we maintain. The amount of financial pressure put on the treasury by our modern army alone is astounding and we need to recognize that fact. While external threats remain, we should worry first about our internal threats before we can even think about fighting the external other."
  USA_increase_middle_income_tax:0 "Read My Lips..."
  USA_increase_middle_income_tax_desc:0 "Former president Bush famously promised to read his lips. We have to break his promise. The ex-president could not have known how deep in the red we have found our nation to be in and taxation is one of only a few options we continue to have as the treasury burns. This will very likely cost us the presidency, but taxation will need to be increased."

  USA_true_republican_economy_desc:0 "Representing to the Congress, the Republican Party has made budget free for a two-year plan, seeking to kick-start the Southern economy through expansion of the manufacturing industry of the South. Already, industrial plants dot the Southern states due to the cheap labour and local access to goods. The Two Year Plan seeks to utilize our advantages and turn them into more cold, hard cash."

These sectors have been slowly privatized under Rumsfeld, but this should be the final push.

  us_republic.1.t:0 "Briefing on the Congressional Situation"
  us_republic.1.d:0 "Good morning, Mr. President, \n\nThe Congress of the Republic lost its GOP majority in 2008 after the poorest showing since the inception of our Republic in Atlanta by former president Bush. With our poor showing, the Common Sense Party and the New Populist Party gained a foot in the door of Congress, despite the GOP remaining the biggest party. Since 2008, cooperation between the three main parties has become the modus operandi of Rumsfeld's administration. The NPP has become a close partner in this, with Common Sense remaining obstructionist. \n\nHowever, the status quo suddenly changed in late 2009, as the issue of the debt ceiling was taken up by Congress. The normal decision to increase the ceiling was suddenly blocked by the NPP, which joined Common Sense in its obstructionist ways due to its overly libertarian economics. Duke rallied against the ceiling in his usual, far-right fashion, tying it to Jewish conspiracies, while Common Sense blocked the ceiling increase on the basis of opposing the spending deficit. The Presidency is now held hostage by Congress, putting a gun to Rumsfeld's head and forcing him to compromise with either the radicals of the NPP, whose ideological motivation may not allow for serious negotiations, or Common Sense."
  us_republic.1.a:0 "A nation held hostage through debt..." 
  us_republic.2.t:0 "The Plot against Congress"
  us_republic.2.d:0 "Frustration has beset the Rumsfeld administration. Congress has acted outside of its jurisdiction and the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, needs to take back control of the anarchist House and Senate. Behind closed doors, decisions are being made and plans are drawn up. A conspiracy is brewing in Atlanta and it will decide America's faith for the coming decades."
  us_republic.2.a:0 "We cannot trust those Congress communists any longer!"

  us_republic.80.t:0 "Another American Civil War"
  us_republic.80.d:0 "The irony is quite palpable, even in the tense office of Rumsfeld and the members of his closest circle. Once more, the Southern US is the birthplace of an American civil war. At least this time it's for a less sinister purpose, even his critics can agree with that sentiment. \n\nStates have flipped to Congress in opposing Rumsfeld. At the same time, Rumsfeld knows that the rest of America watches with baited breath. The socialists in the North will probably not wait for us to clean up Congress to pick at our carcass, nor will Mexico wait for our approval as it eyes up the oil wealth of Texas. In an ideal scenario, we can stop such a crisis from happening by swiftly ending this rebellion." 
  us_republic.80.a:0 "We will break this house before it divides again!" 

  us_republic.99.t:0 "Reaching the Ceiling"
  us_republic.99.desc:0 "We have been unable to find compromise or disband Congress, leaving us without any room to continue paying off the debts of the American Republic. In every sense of the word, except perhaps formal, we have declared a debt default, leaving us in extraordinarily bad position." 
  us_republic.99.a:0 "Damn it!" 

  us_republic.102.t:0 "The Republic supports the New Americans" 
  us_republic.102.d:0 "In an adress to the public of the Republic, President [USA.GetLeader] declared that the Republic would no longer sit idly by while the Texan government brutally surpressed red-blooded Americans and its own citizens for their democratic desire to join the Republic. Referring to the 29th of December attacks that rocked Texas, the President argued that the attacks were a clear signal to the ruling elite of Houston, which were to blind and arrogant to consider the wishes of the people after independence. \n\nThe hostile rhetoric employed by the Republic has put Texas on edge. Expectations are that military conflict will soon arrive to the Lone Star State, as the Republic hungrily looks at Texas and its natural wealth and prosperity, untouched by the fall of the USA and Mexico's military incursions. The question is, however, what kind of action the Republic will employ in pursuing its goal of reunification." 
  us_republic.102.a:0 "Contact the New Americans and plan a coup d'état"
  us_republic.102.b:0 "We cannot wait, we will strike at midnight" 

  us_republic.200.t:0 "Covington Bridge Attack"
  us_republic.200.d:0 "Details about the exact circumstances have been unclear, as the administrations in Philadelphia and Atlanta work around the clock to understand the developing situation near the Covington Bridge near Cincinnati. Clashes have broken out between border guards with life rounds being fired across the Ohio river. A decision needs to be made: stand down or push ahead." 
  us_republic.200.a:0 "Force the troops to stand down!"
  us_republic.200.b:0 "We have the element of surprise, push!" 

  us_republic.207.t:0 "The Awkward Battle of Covington Bridge"
  us_republic.207.d:0 "The struggle between border soldiers have ended with an awkward acknowledgement of the situation by both parties, both declaring their intention to not escalate and commanding their troops to stay down. The tension of Covington bridge has already passed, but some may not be eager to let a good opportunity for war go to waste."
  us_republic.207.a:0 "War has been averted"

  us_republic.601.t:0 "Congress impeaches Rumsfeld"
  us_republic.601.d:0 "Following Rumsfeld's ridiculous display in attempting to disband Congress, every last inch of good will has dissapeared among the opposition, with even moderates of the GOP turning against the radical wing. Led by Republican senate members Jeff Sessions and Mike Huckabee, the moderate faction of the party broke with the majority by voting with the opposition when it came to impeaching president Rumsfeld, easily clearing the majority needed for the process. Rumsfeld has already denounced the \'RINOs\' for holding communist sympathy, but even his most ardent defender has turned rather quiet, fearing for the future of their career and the GOP. \n\nAs Rumsfeld enters history, his vice president, Thomas Ridge, is tasked with leading the GOP administration into the presidential race. With Rumsfeld's last term ending with the failure of his illegal seizure of power and the disruption of the GOP dominant status quo, it isn't expected that the man who threw it all away will be remembered fondly in American history. New VP Mitch McConnell has already stated that he believes Rumsfeld will be remembered alongside presidents like Ronald Reagan and Herbert Hoover as monumental dissapointments in America's long unbroken history of democracy." 
  us_republic.601.a:0 "A sad end for a sad man..." 

  us_republic.701.t:0 "Reconstruction of the GOP"
  us_republic.701.d:0 "Since the sudden chaos and the house arrest of the former President of the Republic, the GOP leadership and its members have been extremely quiet about the political situation developing in Atlanta. Today, however, the GOP came forward for the first time, declaring that their silence was in preperation for upcoming snap elections, as the party prepared itself with new leadership after \'recent events\'. Their new unopposed candidate for the presidential election is billionare Charles Koch, an active face in American politics since his estrangement with Charles Koch, a prominent oligarch donor in the Midwest. Koch has expressed his excitement to run for the office of President and promised a return to pre-Reagan fiscal conservatism and rationality, something that has been celebrated by the moderate wing of the party but which has alerted some, as the sudden shift in the party's ideology has come quite unnatural and without seemingly any rhyme or reason."
  us_republic.701.a:0 "Vote Koch for good governance!"

  us_republic_news.1.t:0 "Rumsfeld Disbands Congress"
  us_republic_news.1.d:0 "In a decision that has stunned commentators across the ex-USA countries and Canada, President Donald Rumsfeld has forced the Congress of the Republic to disband under the threat of laying siege to the old Georgian state congress, which housed the Republic's legislative branch. \n\nThe disbanding of Congress is the finale of a long conflict between the opposition-held House and Senate and the Republican presidency regarding the debt ceiling, as the opposition had \"held the nation hostage\", according to President Rumsfeld, in its decision to not move the ceiling. After months of failed talks, Rumsfeld publicly came forward and announced the disbanding of Congress. Before the opposition could even react to Rumsfeld's illegal decision, the ARAF sided with the President and besieged Congress. \n\nSome have stated that this may be the last nail in the coffin of liberal American democracy. with Congress disbanded, Rumsfeld sets the stage for another decade of GOP supremacy in the Republic's politics."
  us_republic_news.1.a:0 "What will the future hold for America?" 

  us_republic_news.2.t:0 "Congress goes to War with Rumsfeld"
  us_republic_news.2.d:0 "Shock and horror grip many as they closely watch the videos of Republic tanks driving through Atlanta, their crews pledging allegiance to Congress instead of the President after Rumsfeld has failed to disband Congress. Publicly announcing the disbandement yesterday evening, Rumsfeld had hoped he would have the military's support in the matter and force Congress to its knees. His hopes would be swiftly crushed, as brigades of the ARAF confronted Rumsfeld loyalists in Atlanta. \n\nWhile no casualties have yet been made, the events unfolding in the Republic can only end with violent confrontation between those loyal to Congress and American democracy and those loyal to Rumsfeld and his wing of the GOP. Even the Republican Party, the original behemoth of the Republic, has been split by the conflict, with many moderates betraying Rumsfeld in this time of crisis and aligning themselves with Congress and its ruling party, the Common Sense Party. Conflict seems all but assured in the coming weeks."

  POLITICS_THOMAS_RIDGE_DESC:0 "Ridge started his rocky career in politics with the fall of the United States of America after Reagan's proclamation, forced to flee the North after fears of revolution spread and he was personally targeted due to his legal career. Moving to the South, Ridge quickly entered parliament during the tide of Republicanism after the fall for North Carolina. During the Bush era, Ridge took upon him a number of odd jobs and committees, making himself a semi-known star inside the Republican ranks, even if not that popular outside of his own constituency. \n\nRidge truly started his political career after President Bush appointed him to the coveted spot of deputy secretary of national security, leading to his long relation with the vice president, Donald Rumsfeld. It would be this connection that led to Rumsfeld personally championing Ridge as his VP after Bush died. Under Rumsfeld, Ridge has been a simple side-character, having had little actual say in policy due to Rumsfeld's ruthless micromanagement and the powers that be stopping him at every turn of the way, frustrating his moderation efforts. However, now that Rumsfeld is gone, Ridge still knows that he will not make an impact on American history, convined to an administration and a party that will face the tree of hanging men in the coming election. Rumsfeld made a great mistake and the Republicans and Ridge will pay for his gamble."
