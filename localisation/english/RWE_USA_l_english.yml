  RWE_USA_hostile_congress_desc:0 "Since 2009, the United States government has been effectively closed due to the victory of the Common Sense Party in 2008 and the lacking strategy of House minority whip Newt Gingrich. The issue boiled over during negotiations on a new budget, as the deficit of the American Republic has reached a critical level and an impending debt-ceiling crisis looms over Rumsfeld's presidency. \n\nDiscourse between the legislative and executive branches of government have become increasingly spiteful, as Rumsfeld threatens to use his position as Commander-in-Chief and besiege Congress, while Congress threatens with impeachment. Even inside the GOP, members of the moderate caucus have become fed up with the inability of the government to compromise. The noose tightens around Rumsfeld's neck. Can he save his administration?"

The inequality between these rural states and the East, where the offices of power would be vested, are immense and the fall of the old US institutions hasn't helped their problems.

Congress has refused to raise the debt ceiling despite pleas from the Treasury as it quickly approaches the ceiling, overseeing a national debt that cannot be fixed in the short term. Rumsfeld is personally invested in the crisis and has been involved in negotiations with members of Congress, including with the party whips of Common Sense (Newt Gingrich) and the NPP (Clay Higgins), but has been unable to cross the aisle and reach an agreement with the opposition.

  us_republic.1.t:0 "Briefing on the Congressional Situation"
  us_republic.1.d:0 "Good morning, Mr. President, \n\nThe Congress of the Republic lost its GOP majority in 2008 after the poorest showing since the inception of our Republic in Atlanta by former president Bush. With our poor showing, the Common Sense Party and the New Populist Party gained a foot in the door of Congress, despite the GOP remaining the biggest party. Since 2008, cooperation between the three main parties has become the modus operandi of Rumsfeld's administration. The NPP has become a close partner in this, with Common Sense remaining obstructionist. \n\nHowever, the status quo suddenly changed in late 2009, as the issue of the debt ceiling was taken up by Congress. The normal decision to increase the ceiling was suddenly blocked by the NPP, which joined Common Sense in its obstructionist ways due to its overly libertarian economics. Duke rallied against the ceiling in his usual, far-right fashion, tying it to Jewish conspiracies, while Common Sense blocked the ceiling increase on the basis of opposing the spending deficit. The Presidency is now held hostage by Congress, putting a gun to Rumsfeld's head and forcing him to compromise with either the radicals of the NPP, whose ideological motivation may not allow for serious negotiations, or Common Sense."
  us_republic.1.a:0 "A nation held hostage through debt..." 
  us_republic.2.t:0 "The Plot against Congress"
  us_republic.2.d:0 "Frustration has beset the Rumsfeld administration. Congress has acted outside of its jurisdiction and the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, needs to take back control of the anarchist House and Senate. Behind closed doors, decisions are being made and plans are drawn up. A conspiracy is brewing in Atlanta and it will decide America's faith for the coming decades."

  us_republic.80.t:0 "Another American Civil War"
  us_republic.80.d:0 "The irony is quite palpable, even in the tense office of Rumsfeld and the members of his closest circle. Once more, the Southern US is the birthplace of an American civil war. At least this time it's for a less sinister purpose, even his critics can agree with that sentiment. \n\nStates have flipped to Congress in opposing Rumsfeld. At the same time, Rumsfeld knows that the rest of America watches with baited breath. The socialists in the North will probably not wait for us to clean up Congress to pick at our carcass, nor will Mexico wait for our approval as it eyes up the oil wealth of Texas. In an ideal scenario, we can stop such a crisis from happening by swiftly ending this rebellion."

  us_republic.102.d:0 "In an adress to the public of the Republic, President [USA.GetLeader] declared that the Republic would no longer sit idly by while the Texan government brutally surpressed red-blooded Americans and its own citizens for their democratic desire to join the Republic. Referring to the 29th of December attacks that rocked Texas, the President argued that the attacks were a clear signal to the ruling elite of Houston, which were to blind and arrogant to consider the wishes of the people after independence. \n\nThe hostile rhetoric employed by the Republic has put Texas on edge. Expectations are that military conflict will soon arrive to the Lone Star State, as the Republic hungrily looks at Texas and its natural wealth and prosperity, untouched by the fall of the USA and Mexico's military incursions. The question is, however, what kind of action the Republic will employ in pursuing its goal of reunification."

OPEC hasn't enacted collective sanctions like this previously, marking it as an unprecedented foreign policy coordination between vastly different countries. For the Republic, it means that our access to almost half of the global fossil fuel production has just dissapeared."

  us_republic.209.t:0 "The Missouri \'Referendum\'"
  us_republic.209.d:0 "Chaos and Confusion has stricken the federation of Illinois and Missouri, as \'local American unification groups\' have taken control of the Missouri state capitol building and other important political locations across the region, welcoming unification with the Atlanta government with open arms. Already, Republican troops have crossed the border into the state of Missouri with the intention of \'liberating\' these patriots, despite heavy condemnation from Saint Louis and Springfield. The Republic has justified their presence not just as a humanitarian mission, but with the promise of a democratic referendum on the issue of unification with Atlanta. This promise has been unilateral, as Illinois and Missouri haven't given the greenlight for this plan. \n\nUnder our occupation, we have promised a coming referendum on Missouri statehood in the Republic, which will cement the justification of our incursion. If Missouri accepts integration as a full state, our military presence will remain and Missouri joins our other states."

  us_republic.210.t:0 "The Republic violates our Sovereignty"
  us_republic.210.d:0 "Despite the Houston Treaty, the Republic recently retracted its recognition of our small federation as it prepared itself for aggression. Today, their troops have moved into Missouri and occupied half of our proud nation, seeking to dismantle us entirely and repress our unique culture. We must not accept such a faith. \n\nStill, the size of the Republic's military force is like Goliath, while ours is David. Can we humble Atlanta in any way with our small volunteer force?"
  us_republic.210.a:0 "We cannot provoke a full war with Atlanta..."
  us_republic.210.b:0 "To hell with caution, Missouri will remain ours!" 
  us_republic.213.t:0 "Philadelphia guarantees Illinois Independence"
  us_republic.213.d:0 "After our recent manuever into Missouri, Illinois has approached the American People's Commonwealth for a security guarantee in the face of what it has perceived as Republican expansionism. The Commonwealth, eager to get in our way and turn situations tenser across the East Coast, has accepted and guaranteed the sovereignty of Springfield."
  us_republic.213.a:0 "Damn commies!" 
  us_republic.216.t:0 "Philadelphia moves into Illinois"
  us_republic.216.d:0 "Our recent manuever into Missouri has forced Illinois into compromise with the socialist government of the north, allowing it to replace the Springfield government with a Commonwealth-aligned red government in an agreement to protect Illinois against Republican imperialism. Once again, Philadelphia has shown its bad side and expanded into our sphere of influence, forcing us to make a move in the future." 
  us_republic.216.a:0 "Damn commies!" 

  us_republic.300.t:0 "Our Preferred Man in Philly"
  us_republic.300.d:0 "Our intelligence community suggests that times are changing in the North, as the situation of president Naom Chomsky has become unsustainable. As political lines are drawn in the sand in Philadelphia, our men on the inside have analyzed the situation and typed out a report, suggesting a few notable characters as possibly interesting for us. The main two are the leaders of two opposing factions inside the Commonwealth, namely Bill Gates and Bernie Sanders. Their rivalry is currently splitting the nation in half and it may even throw the country into serious chaos depending on the actions they seek to take in the coming months. \n\nFor us, these two men represent opportunities, though it is unclear if they represent good or bad opportunities. Sanders seems to our men as a soft-spoken career politician, unlikely to maintain Chomsky's dogmatic foreign policy and open to talks with our country. Bill Gates, on the other hand, is rather ideological, having drafted an entire manifesto on Commonwealth policy and politics along technocratic lines, but isn't a particularly hard leader either. If he isn't too busy with his domestic dreams, he will be unlikely to properly rock the boat in any way, shape or form. It is up to us to decide if we trust our information and utilize it in the defense of our national interests."

  us_republic.601.d:0 "Following Rumsfeld's ridiculous display in attempting to disband Congress, every last inch of good will has dissapeared among the opposition, with even moderates of the GOP turning against the radical wing. Led by Republican senate members Jeff Sessions and Mike Huckabee, the moderate faction of the party broke with the majority by voting with the opposition when it came to impeaching president Rumsfeld, easily clearing the majority needed for the process. Rumsfeld has already denounced the \'RINOs\' for holding communist sympathy, but even his most ardent defender has turned rather quiet, fearing for the future of their career and the GOP. \n\nAs Rumsfeld enters history, his vice president, Thomas Ridge, is tasked with leading the GOP administration into the presidential race. With Rumsfeld's last term ending with the failure of his illegal seizure of power and the disruption of the GOP dominant status quo, it isn't expected that the man who threw it all away will be remembered fondly in American history. New VP Mitch McConnell has already stated that he believes Rumsfeld will be remembered alongside presidents like Ronald Reagan and Herbert Hoover as monumental dissapointments in America's long unbroken history of democracy."

  us_republic.602.d:0 "The Oklahoma panhandle, once a solidly Republican region, has slowly been swayed by the extreme NPP as decades of neglect by a GOP government in Atlanta has left the periphery feeling abandoned and without hope. It is thus the first region of the Republic that seems on track to become a majority NPP bloc, as the popular Oklahoma star of the NPP, John Bennett, has recently visited the region with the election in mind to rally support for the NPP. \n\nDespite this news, nuance shouldn't be forgotten. The panhandle is called no man's land for a reason in quite some places and its small population obviously allows for such a radical swing from GOP to NPP in a few years that won't be replicated on a national level. The panhandle is, however, part of a larger trend, some analysists urge, as the NPP's popularity has only grown during the Rumsfeld administration."

The change of the word recognizes unique American cuisine and its roots in our democratic tradition, while rejecting any connection to the foul communist European kitchen and Paris's loyalty to Moscow. \n\nThe French have obviously protested our decision as an act of naked ultranationalism, but who cares about a nation we barely trade with across the other side of the Atlantic? The American people will enjoy their freedom fries as a protest against communism, dictatorship and Marx."

  us_republic_news.1.d:0 "In a decision that has stunned commentators across the ex-USA countries and Canada, President Donald Rumsfeld has forced the Congress of the Republic to disband under the threat of laying siege to the old Georgian state congress, which housed the Republic's legislative branch. \n\nThe disbanding of Congress is the finale of a long conflict between the opposition-held House and Senate and the Republican presidency regarding the debt ceiling, as the opposition had \"held the nation hostage\", according to President Rumsfeld, in its decision to not move the ceiling. After months of failed talks, Rumsfeld publicly came forward and announced the disbanding of Congress. Before the opposition could even react to Rumsfeld's illegal decision, the ARAF sided with the President and besieged Congress. \n\nSome have stated that this may be the last nail in the coffin of liberal American democracy. with Congress disbanded, Rumsfeld sets the stage for another decade of GOP supremacy in the Republic's politics."

Publicly announcing the disbandement yesterday evening, Rumsfeld had hoped he would have the military's support in the matter and force Congress to its knees. His hopes would be swiftly crushed, as brigades of the ARAF confronted Rumsfeld loyalists in Atlanta. \n\nWhile no casualties have yet been made, the events unfolding in the Republic can only end with violent confrontation between those loyal to Congress and American democracy and those loyal to Rumsfeld and his wing of the GOP. Even the Republican Party, the original behemoth of the Republic, has been split by the conflict, with many moderates betraying Rumsfeld in this time of crisis and aligning themselves with Congress and its ruling party, the Common Sense Party. Conflict seems all but assured in the coming weeks."

The government, which was able to evade capture and move to Springfield, have loudly condemned the violation of their territorial integrity and demand action from the rest of the world to the Republic's naked irredentism. \n\nCurrently, the international community has given a limited response, few planning to defend Illinois and risk open conflict with the Atlanta government. Still, development to the Missouri occupation is still ongoing and Illinois may find itself yet guaranteed by the many powers with geopolitical interests in the region."

Both states now are engaged in an open conflict along the Mississippi river, making military manuevering rather difficult across the two states of the federation. \n\nThe sudden war has sparked debate in the international community, as the Republic has displayed its naked aggression to the entire world once more. However, many states don't have any interest in the region of the Mississippi and the few that do aren't seeking to risk dragging themselves into a conflict with Atlanta.

  POLITICS_THOMAS_RIDGE_DESC:0 "Ridge started his rocky career in politics with the fall of the United States of America after Reagan's proclamation, forced to flee the North after fears of revolution spread and he was personally targeted due to his legal career. Moving to the South, Ridge quickly entered parliament during the tide of Republicanism after the fall for North Carolina. During the Bush era, Ridge took upon him a number of odd jobs and committees, making himself a semi-known star inside the Republican ranks, even if not that popular outside of his own constituency. \n\nRidge truly started his political career after President Bush appointed him to the coveted spot of deputy secretary of national security, leading to his long relation with the vice president, Donald Rumsfeld. It would be this connection that led to Rumsfeld personally championing Ridge as his VP after Bush died. Under Rumsfeld, Ridge has been a simple side-character, having had little actual say in policy due to Rumsfeld's ruthless micromanagement and the powers that be stopping him at every turn of the way, frustrating his moderation efforts. However, now that Rumsfeld is gone, Ridge still knows that he will not make an impact on American history, convined to an administration and a party that will face the tree of hanging men in the coming election. Rumsfeld made a great mistake and the Republicans and Ridge will pay for his gamble."
